  • Limitations: Lacks comprehensive email and collaboration protection, no XDR or managed services.

- **Worry-Free Services Advanced**  
  Adds email / cloud app / collaboration protections; fills many gaps left by the base Services edition.

- **Worry-Free XDR**  
  Adds detection & response, improved visibility across email + endpoints. Good if you need more insight into threats.

- **Co-Managed & Managed XDR**  
  Suitable if internal resources are limited, or if you prefer to offload part of detection, investigation, and response to Trend Micro or partner experts.
